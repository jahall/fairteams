# fairteams

Choose fair teams from a pool of players.

## TODO
Must have:
1. Improve player side by side view by:
  a. Making custom list tile
  b. Having an edit option which adds checkboxes and options to swap players
  c. Have option to revert to "optimal" teams
2. Put analysis at the top with optional switch to spider chart and only have scroll for teams
3. Make group list of skills editable

Nice to have:
4. Persist data in shared preferences in data blob
5. Add historical matches with dates, scores and comments
