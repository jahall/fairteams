# fairteams

Choose fair teams from a pool of players.

## TODO
Must have:
1. Migrate algorithm into `teams.dart`
2. Display team comparison
3. Edit/delete buttons to main page...to avoid nulls
4. Figure out missing name issue in group edit...

Nice to have:
1. Make skills editable
2. Persist data in shared preferences in data blob
3. Allow drag-and-drop swapping of players in teams view
4. Add historical matches with dates, scores and comments
